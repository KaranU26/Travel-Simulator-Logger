# Travel-Simulator-Logger
This software must be run on Ubuntu. This program simulates cars driving, running out of fuel, and refueling. The client and server communicate with one another. The server prints out different levels of logs on the command line and also saves it into a log file. The log messages recieved by the server can be filtered to show only certain levels of log levels.
